Note: all changes would be commited over here, either replace whole file with new file or better is make changes in the particular file and commit it.
 
## Description:
A CNN model for the detection of a variety of animal species which are captured with the help of the mobile application. We are making predictions in real-time, as the animal comes in front of the camera, each frame would be sent to the system where our model will produce the output within a few micro-seconds.
Project Consists of the following subtask:
1. Data Exploration and Collection
2. Dataset Creation
3. Data Preprocessing
4. Image Preprocessing
5. Model Creation
6. Model Training with Optimization and Enhancement
7. Using a Trained model with Computer Vision Techniques
